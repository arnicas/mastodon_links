# Mastodon_links

This is a fork/clone of the smart [https://github.com/mauforonda/mastodon_links](https://github.com/mauforonda/mastodon_links).

It runs on github actions to generate you a page at, e.g., [https://arnicas.github.io/mastodon_links/](https://arnicas.github.io/mastodon_links/).

See also their lovely fork/edit [mastodon_digest](https://github.com/mauforonda/mastodon_digest) based on hodesmr's code. This also runs on github actions and has a nice two-column layout design.
