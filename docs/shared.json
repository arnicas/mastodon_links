That is $11 million every minute, earmarked for planetary destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world launched unprecedented financial rescue packages. These recovery plans were seen as a huge opportunity to set humanity on a brand-new course for a more sustainable economic paradigm. They were called \u2018our last chance to avert a climate disaster,\u2019 as the enormous size of the investments would make it impossible for us to undo their consequences in the future if we got that funding even slightly wrong,\u201d she said.</p><p>But, according to the International Energy Agency, only 2 percent of those massive financial aid packages went toward green energy, Thunberg said.</p><p>\u201cOur leaders completely failed,\u201d she wrote.</p><p>\u201cAnd they continue to fail; despite all the beautiful words and pledges, they are not moving in the right direction. In fact, we are still expanding fossil fuel infrastructure all over the world. In many cases, we are even speeding up the process. China is planning to build 43 new coal power plants on top of the 1,000 plants already in operation. In the U.S., approvals for companies to drill for oil and fossil methane gas are on schedule to reach their highest level since the presidency of George W.

But since you're reading this, that is obviously not enough to convince you, so allow me to present further arguments. Let's talk about Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>Let's start with the fact that <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-lead-designer-used-to-run-anti-social-j-1846316222\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Warner Brothers knowingly hired</a> a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hogwarts-legacy-designer-alt-right/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">far-right gamergate youtuber</a> as lead developer for the game, shortly after which details of the game were revealed, including the fact that <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/harry-potter-goblins-antisemitic-jon-stewart/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aforementioned antisemitic carricatures</a> would be central to the plot, namely in the form of <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/hogwarts-legacy-goblins-antisemitism/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a sinister plot and uprising</a> which includes <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/hogwarts-legacy-antisemitism-goblins-horn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">kidnapping a child</a>. Let me recap: the greedy, treacherous, hook-nosed bankers who hate regular wizards kidnap a child. If the words 'blood libel' \u2013 the belief that Jews steal children, a trope perpetuated in modern-day conspiracy theories about 'grooming' or 'woke indoctrination' \u2013 didn't mean anything to you: <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-term/blood-libel-false-incendiary-claim-against-jews\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">now they do</a>. That this rebellion is motivated by the <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-goblin-rebellion-history-lore-explained/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">centuries-long oppression of the goblins, who are denied civil rights, access to wands, and basically left with no business but to run banks (sound familiar?) and the goblins' desire for liberation, how dare they</a>, is only the cherry on top, as is <a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/hogwarts-legacy-faces-even-more-undeniable-evidence-of-being-antisemitic-as-details-about-goblin-rebellion-match-horrifying-real-life-events/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">featuring a Jewish instrument, which just so happens to be dated in-game to the year of a real-life pogrom</a>. Oh, and <a href=\"https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/03/the-sword-until-recently-known-as-gryffindors/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">did you know that Goblins believe workers should own what they produce</a>? That's right, the thinly-veiled jew-stand-ins are Marxists! You might want to look up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art#Cultural_Bolshevism\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">'Cultural Bolshevism'</a> (nazis today say <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">'Cultural Marxism'</a>), and take a long hard look at Deathly Hallows again.</p><p>\u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://eldritch.cafe/@amberage/109838270027970651\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2\u2026</a></p>"
