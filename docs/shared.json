There were always criticisms of her works (and I don't mean the frankly plebeian style), such as the fact that the goblins, <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/comment/comment/harry-potter-is-gringotts-picture-antisemitic-1.482785\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hook-nosed, hunched bankers with a love for plotting and betrayal</a> reside in a building with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamHaft/status/1064232757805617152\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">star of david on the floor</a>, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/544946669448867841\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hasty retcon of a singular Jewish character (with the most clich\u00e9 name of 'Goldstein')</a>, the subplot about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/24/harry-potter-race-muggles-black-hermione\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">enslaved servants who love slavery and hate being freed</a>, and so on and so forth, but by and large, most people saw her as the author of their favourite books, and that was it.</p><p>Since then, Rowling has come out in support of the current <a href=\"https://www.lemkininstitute.com/statements-new-page/statement-on-the-genocidal-nature-of-the-gender-critical-movement%E2%80%99s-ideology-and-practice\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">genocidal</a> campaign against trans people, ostensibly out of concern for women's rights, despite the fact that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1462758716684611597\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">people she has supported</a> call anti-abortion crusaders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Docstockk/status/1540306147328024576\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">'fine people'</a>, people on her side <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2022/07/why-im-suing-survivors-network/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sue rape crisis centers</a>, and of course <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/stop-using-phony-science-to-justify-transphobia/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in spite</a> of <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beyond-xx-and-xy-the-extraordinary-complexity-of-sex-determination/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">all known science</a>, in support of <a href=\"https://neurosciencenews.com/gender-dysphoria-myth-19878/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">disproven junk science</a>, <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/19021/AAP-continues-to-support-care-of-transgender\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">going against</a> <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-states-stop-interfering-health-care-transgender-children\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">all major</a> <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/09/ce-corner\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scientific</a> <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/frontline-physicians-oppose-legislation-that-interferes-in-or-penalizes-patient-care/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">organisations</a>, and on the same side as <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yabp/covid-anti-vaxxers-mocking-trans-people-with-transvaxxite-videos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anti</a>-<a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/10/01/graham-linehan-covid-transphobia-climate-change/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vaxxers</a>, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/09/05/chicago-hospital-teams-with-schools-to-promote-sex-toys-to-kids/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">far-right</a> <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/chicago-childrens-hospital-partners-with-local-school-districts-to-promote-radical-gender-theory\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">extremists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thesocialreview.co.uk/2021/01/02/transphobia-and-antisemitism/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anti</a>-<a href=\"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-antisemitic-conspiracy-theories-fueling-transphobia/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">semites</a>, <a href=\"https://chican3ry.medium.com/jk-rowling-gender-ideology-and-antisemitism-7dd043bad37b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more anti-semites</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/19691745.bbc-scandal-lily-cade-calls-trans-women-executed/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">authors of murderous manifests</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.aidsmap.com/news/may-2021/whos-financing-anti-gender-movement-europe\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">desinformation oligarchs</a>. It is no coincidence that <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rowling's public conversion into an avid transphobe</a> corresponds closely with the <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/anti-trans-lgbtq-legislation-2023-new-laws\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skyrocketing of anti-trans bills</a>, going from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/10/14/anti-trans-bills/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">60 bills in 2020 to 131 in 2021</a>, making 2021 <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/2021-officially-becomes-worst-year-in-recent-history-for-lgbtq-state-legislative-attacks-as-unprecedented-number-of-states-enact-record-shattering-number-of-anti-lgbtq-measures-into-law\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the worst year at the time</a>, and further to a staggering <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/over-120-bills-restricting-lgbtq-rights-introduced-nationwide-2023-so-far\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">120 bills in three weeks</a> in early 2023 alone (that would be 2305 bills this entire year, if kept up)!</p><p>So far, so awful. But since you're reading this, that is obviously not enough to convince you, so allow me to present further arguments. Let's talk about Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>Let's start with the fact that <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-lead-designer-used-to-run-anti-social-j-1846316222\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Warner Brothers knowingly hired</a> a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hogwarts-legacy-designer-alt-right/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">far-right gamergate youtuber</a> as lead developer for the game, shortly after which details of the game were revealed, including the fact that <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/harry-potter-goblins-antisemitic-jon-stewart/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aforementioned antisemitic carricatures</a> would be central to the plot, namely in the form of <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/hogwarts-legacy-goblins-antisemitism/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a sinister plot and uprising</a> which includes <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/hogwarts-legacy-antisemitism-goblins-horn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">kidnapping a child</a>. Let me recap: the greedy, treacherous, hook-nosed bankers who hate regular wizards kidnap a child. If the words 'blood libel' \u2013 the belief that Jews steal children, a trope perpetuated in modern-day conspiracy theories about 'grooming' or 'woke indoctrination' \u2013 didn't mean anything to you: <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-term/blood-libel-false-incendiary-claim-against-jews\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">now they do</a>. That this rebellion is motivated by the <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-goblin-rebellion-history-lore-explained/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">centuries-long oppression of the goblins, who are denied civil rights, access to wands, and basically left with no business but to run banks (sound familiar?) and the goblins' desire for liberation, how dare they</a>, is only the cherry on top, as is <a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/hogwarts-legacy-faces-even-more-undeniable-evidence-of-being-antisemitic-as-details-about-goblin-rebellion-match-horrifying-real-life-events/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">featuring a Jewish instrument, which just so happens to be dated in-game to the year of a real-life pogrom</a>. Oh, and <a href=\"https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/03/the-sword-until-recently-known-as-gryffindors/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">did you know that Goblins believe workers should own what they produce</a>? That's right, the thinly-veiled jew-stand-ins are Marxists! You might want to look up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art#Cultural_Bolshevism\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">'Cultural Bolshevism'</a> (nazis today say <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">'Cultural Marxism'</a>), and take a long hard look at Deathly Hallows again.</p><p>\u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://eldritch.cafe/@amberage/109838270027970651\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2\u2026</a></p>"
